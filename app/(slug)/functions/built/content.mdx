# Where

The where clause is used to filter records. The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

```sql
SELECT ArtistID FROM Artist WHERE name = 'The Postal Service';
```


```sql
SELECT ArtistID FROM Artist WHERE ArtistId =174;
```

# Like
The like operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

```sql
SELECT ArtistID FROM Artist WHERE name LIKE 'The%';
```


# LIMIT and OFFSET
Limit and offset are used to restrict the number of rows returned by the query. The limit will restrict the number of rows to return, and the offset will specify where to begin.

This is used for pagination. For example, if you have 100 records and you want to show 10 records per page, you can use limit 10 offset 0 for the first page, limit 10 offset 10 for the second page, and so on.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5;
```

# ORDER BY
The order by clause is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Artist ORDER BY name LIMIT 5;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM Artist ORDER BY name DESC LIMIT 5;
```


```sql
SELECT * FROM Artist ORDER BY name ASC LIMIT 5;
```


# JOIN 
Join is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

```sql
SELECT
    Artist.Name, Album.Title
FROM
    Album
JOIN
    Artist ON
        Album.ArtistId = Artist.ArtistId
LIMIT 5;
```

```sql
SELECT
    b.Name, a.Title
FROM
    Album a
JOIN
    Artist b ON
        a.ArtistId = b.ArtistId
LIMIT 5;
```

# Explain
Explain is used to get the query execution plan. It shows how the query will be executed.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Track Where name ='Black Dog';
```

# INdex 
Index is used to speed up the query. It is used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly.
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_track_name ON Track (Name);
```
